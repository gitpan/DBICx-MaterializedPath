=head1 NAME

DBICx::MaterializedPath - L<DBIx::Class> plugin for automatically tracking lineage paths in simple data trees (beta software).

=head1 VERSION

0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

We need a table, or tables, which represents a tree.

 CREATE TABLE tree_data (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    parent INT(10),
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    path VARCHAR(255),
    created DATETIME(19) NOT NULL
 );
 
 CREATE INDEX tree_data_idx_parent ON tree_data (parent);

In your L<DBIx::Class> add this to your componentsE<ndash>

 use warnings;
 use strict;
 use parent qw( DBIx::Class );
 
 __PACKAGE__->load_components(qw(
                                 +DBICx::MaterializedPath
                                 Core
                                 ));
 # Et cetera.
 __PACKAGE__->parent_column("parent"); # default "parent"
 __PACKAGE__->path_column("path");     # default "materiazlied_path"
 __PACKAGE__->path_separator(".");     # default "/"
 __PACKAGE__->max_depth(10);           # default "500"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Uses a column of a table with a tree structure to keep track of lineage. An example lineage showing primary key idsE<ndash>

 #  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 10 -> 999 -> 8 -> 42

 my $rec = $result_source->find(999);
 say $rec->parent->id; # prints "10"

It's trivial to find the parent and easy to recurse on the parent to find all ancestors. With a deep tree it becomes somewhat expensive. Take the example above, for example. If you want to get the entire lineage for the record with id "42" you have to do six queries against the database. If you maintain a materialized path you only have to do one.

Consider our record "42" again. With its path 1/2/3/10/999/8/42 we can easily find all its parentsE<ndash>

 my $path = "1/2/3/10/999/8/42";
 my @ancestor_ids = split '/', $path;
 pop @ancestor_ids; # Remove the self id.
 my @ancestors = $result_source
                      ->search({ parent => { -in => \@ancestor_ids },
                               { order_by => \"LENGTH(path)" });

We can thank the great and powerful Ovid's co-worker Mark MorganE<mdash>L<http://use.perl.org/~Ovid/journal/39460>E<mdash>for the sorting solution for ensuring the proper order of ancestors is returned.

=head2 CAVEAT

This package requires your table has a single primary key and a method to look up a parent record by its single primary key.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item [path method]

Whatever column you set for your materialized path. In the L</SYNOPSIS> code it is set to C<path> to match the sample table definition. The default if you don't set one is C<materialized_path>. This will, of course, cause errors if there is no such column in the table.

=item ancestors

Searches on the materialized path ids excepting the object's own. This is generally cheap because it uses the path instead of recursion.

=item get_root

Returns the root object for a given record.

=item grandchildren

Iterates through all children and grandchildren.

=item node_depth

Returns 1 for a record with no parent.

=item root_node

=item siblings

=item max_depth

Set this to assert a maximum tree depth. Default is 500.

=item set_materialized_path

Probably shouldn't mess with this. It's used by L</insert> and L</delete>.

=back

=head2 OVERRIDDEN METHODS

=over 4

=item insert

Sets the materialized path.

=item update

Updates which change the parent of a record necessarily cascade through all their children and grandchildren to recompute and set their new materialized paths. E.g., given this treeE<ndash>

                  1
                  |
                  3
                 / \
               12   8
              /\    /\
             5 13  7  4

You get paths including B<1/3/12/13> and B<1/3/4>. Let's say we change record 3's parent from 1 to 2E<ndash>

                  2
                  |
                  3
                 / \
               12   8
              /\    /\
             5 13  7  4

The change is simple and it's obvious you have to update record 3 but you just broke the materialized path for records 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, and 13. In a big tree you may have broken hundreds or even thousands of paths with a single parent change. So we have to process all descendants. Our example paths become B<2/3/12/13> and B<2/3/4>. Again, it may seem trivial but it may be expensive depending on the tree's depth and breadth. This simplistic example will require three database readsE<mdash>children of 3, children of 12, children of 8E<mdash>and six updatesE<mdash>each of 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, and 13. This doesn't even count the original expense of finding and updating 3 itself. But the point here is that we should have a write seldom, read often situation and this up front expense may save exponentially with regards to ongoing query costs.

=back

=head1 CAVEATS

If your materialized path column is insufficiently large you're going to have problems. A C<VARCHAR(255)> is only wide enough to support a tree which is 35 nodes deep if the average PK values are integers in the millions. This might be fine for your usage. Just be aware path tracking is not arbitrary, it's limited to the column's width.

=head1 TO DO

=over 4

=item Better documents; obviously.

=item More tests; what else is new?

One set with nothing changed: use default column names.

One set with everything changed.

L<DBIx::Class::Ordered>, L<DBIx::Class>.

=head2 WHY NOT DBIx::Class::Ordered?

There are data sets which have implicit, or even tacit, orderingE<mdash>E<rdquo>positionE<ldquo> in L<DBIx::Class::Ordered> parlanceE<ndash> in the data already. Published articles, for example, will be naturally ordered chronologically. Additional position tracking becomes complex and redundant in this kind of case. You can even run into cases where both types of ordering are necessary like a collection of dictionaries. Each dictionary's terms are ordered alphabetically while each term's definitions would be ordered by a position set at editorial discretion.
